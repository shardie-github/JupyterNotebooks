## RISK MITIGATION FOR RESOURCES

### Resource Availability Risks

1. **Key Consultant Unavailable**

   - **Knowledge Transfer**: Weekly documentation updates

3. **Budget Overruns**
   - **Mitigation**: Weekly budget reviews, prioritize critical items
   - **Contingency**: 10% buffer built into budget

4. **Tool Limitations**

4. **Interns/Junior Staff**
   - Use interns for research, documentation, content
   - Save 60-70% on costs
   - Trade-off: More supervision needed
