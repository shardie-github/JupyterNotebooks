# Agent Factory Platform

> Build production-ready AI agents for higher education in minutes, not months.

**Agent Factory** is a composable, extensible platform for building, deploying, and monetizing AI agents, strategically designed for **higher education institutions** and **lifelong learning organizations** in partnership with **McGraw Hill Education**.

Transform from notebooks to production with our Python library, CLI, and REST API. Perfect for creating virtual teaching assistants, personalized learning agents, research assistants, and more.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install agent-factory
```

### Create Your First Agent

```python
from agent_factory import Agent, function_tool

@function_tool
def calculate(expression: str) -> float:
    """Calculate mathematical expressions."""
    return eval(expression)

agent = Agent(
    id="my-agent",
    name="My Agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    tools=[calculate],
)

result = agent.run("Calculate 15% tip on $87.50")
print(result.output)
```

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Initialize a project
agent-factory init my_project

# Create an agent
agent-factory agent create my-agent --name "My Agent" --instructions "You are helpful"

# Run an agent
agent-factory agent run my-agent --input "Hello!"
```

### Using the API

```bash
# Start the API server
uvicorn agent_factory.api.main:app --reload

# Create an agent via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "my-agent", "name": "My Agent", "instructions": "You are helpful"}'
```
